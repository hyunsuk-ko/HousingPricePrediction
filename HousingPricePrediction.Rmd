## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis

## EDA

- id: Unique ID for each home sold 
- date: Date of the home sale 
- price: Price of each home sold
- bedrooms: Number of bedroom 
bathrooms: Number of bathrooms, where .5 accounts for a room with a toilet but no shower
- sqft_living: Square footage of the apartments interior living space 
- sqft_lot: Square footage of the land space
- floors: Number of floors
- waterfront: A dummy variable for whether the apartment was overlooking the waterfront or not 
- view: An index from 0 to 4 of how good the view of the property was 
- condition: An index from 1 to 5 on the condition of the apartment,
- grade: An index from 1 to 13, where 1-3 falls short of building construction and design, 7 has an average level of                  
      construction and design, and 11-13 have a high quality level of construction and design.
- sqft_above: The square footage of the interior housing space that is above ground level 
- sqft_basement: The square footage of the interior housing space that is below ground level 
- yr_built: The year the house was initially built
- yr_renovated: The year of the houseâ€™s last renovation
- zipcode: What zipcode area the house is in 
- lat: Lattitude 
- long: Longitude 
- sqft_living15: The square footage of interior housing living space for the nearest 15 neighbors 
- sqft_lot15: The square footage of the land lots of the nearest 15 neighbors
